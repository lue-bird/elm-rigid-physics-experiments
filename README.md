Physics of a body composed of connected bones.
Just run `elm reactor`.

- drag any point with right mouse button and see the shape rearrange
- notice that some points are fixed in place and others can move freely.
  double click a point to toggle between fixed and free movement
- press anywhere on the background and drag to an existing point to create a new bone
- drag from an existing point to another to add a bone between them
  or drag to anywhere on the background to create a new bone to the new point
- TODO: delete a bone
- TODO: shrink/grow a bone
- TODO (kind of already exists): multiple bodies
- TODO: export bodies as elm code
