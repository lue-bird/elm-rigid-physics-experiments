Just run `elm reactor`.

- drag any point and see the shape rearrange
- notice that some points are fixed in place and others can move freely
- press anywhere on the background and drag to an existing point to create a new bone
- TODO: add a bone between existing points
- TODO: toggle points between fixed and free movement
- TODO: delete a bone
- TODO: delete a point
- TODO: shrink/grow a bone
- TODO: multiple bodies
